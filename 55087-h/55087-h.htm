<h2 class="xl lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards

no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves: and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means."</p></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The claim of the Spanish Government to the right of
search, and the aggressions committed by that power on
the commerce of Great Britain, in the West Indies, by
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">guarda-costas</i>, and other ships acting by authority
of the King of Spain, contrary to the existing treaties,
led to a convention between the two Crowns, which was
concluded on the 14th of January, 1739. This convention
stipulated, that compensation should be made by
Spain to the English Government, in reparation for the
hostilities committed on the British subjects in the
American seas. The Court of Madrid, however, violated
the convention, and ultimately war was proclaimed
against Spain on the 23rd of October, 1739.</p>

<p>Augmentations were accordingly made in the army
and navy; ten regiments of Marines were raised in this
and the following year; these corps were embarked on
board the fleets under Admirals Vernon and Sir Chaloner
Ogle, which proceeded against the Spanish possessions
in South America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>While the war was being carried on between Great
Britain and Spain, Charles the Sixth, Emperor of
Germany, died on the 20th of October, 1740; and the
succession of his daughter, the Archduchess Maria
Theresa, to his hereditary dominions, being disputed
by the Electors of Bavaria and Saxony, also by the Kings
of Prussia and Spain, a continental war was the result,
in which England and France, acting in the first instance
as auxiliaries, finally became principals in the contest,
which has since been known as the "<em>War of the Austrian
Succession</em>." The King of France, Louis XV., supported
the Elector of Bavaria, while King George II.,
adhering to the "<em>Pragmatic Sanction</em>,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to which nearly
all the powers of Europe had been parties, supported
the claims of the Archduchess Maria Theresa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>In January, 1741, seven additional regiments<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> were
raised for the regular Infantry, and were numbered in
succession to the ten regiments of marines, from the
<em>Fifty-fourth</em> to the <em>Sixtieth</em> regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> was one of these seven regiments,
and the command of the corps was conferred by King
George II. on Colonel John Price, from the First Foot
Guards, whose commission was dated the 13th of
January, 1741. The regiment consisted of ten companies,
of three serjeants, three corporals, two drummers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>and seventy privates each; and its numbers, including
officers, amounted to eight hundred and fifteen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In March, 1742, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment was
stationed at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

<p>In May, 1742, several regiments were embarked for
Flanders under Field Marshal the Earl of Stair, to
support Maria Theresa, the Queen of Hungary and
Bohemia; but the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment remained
in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment was afterwards stationed
at Berwick, and in October received orders to
proceed to North Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>On the 23rd of June, 1743, Colonel the Honorable
Thomas Murray, from the Third Foot Guards, was
promoted Colonel of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment,
in succession to Colonel John Price, removed to the
fourteenth foot.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile King George II. had joined the
army at Aschaffenberg, and on the 27th of June gained
a victory over the French army, under Marshal Noailles
at <em>Dettingen</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>France and Great Britain, from auxiliaries, now became
principals in the contest. On the 20th of March, 1744,
France declared war against England, and on the 29th
of that month a counter declaration was made by Great
Britain, in which the French monarch was accused of
violating the "<em>Pragmatic Sanction</em>," and of assisting the
son of the Pretender in his designs on the British
throne.</p>

<p>The operations of the British army in Flanders during
the year 1744 were confined to the defensive, and no
general engagement occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>After the battle of <em>Fontenoy</em>, fought on the 11th of
May, 1745, Louis XV. revived the claims of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Pretender<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to the throne of Great Britain. Prince Charles
Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, arrived in the
Highlands of Scotland towards the end of July, where
he was joined by several clans.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment at this period formed
part of the force in Scotland, and Lieut.-General Sir
John Cope, the Commander in Chief in North Britain,
assembled all the troops under his orders at Stirling,
which consisted of about fourteen hundred men. He
afterwards advanced towards the great road called the
Chain, leading through the Highlands to Inverness, and
after a laborious march, arrived at Dalwhinny on the
25th of August. Here intelligence was received that
the rebels were posted at Corryarrack, seventeen miles
distant, upon which Lieut.-General Sir John Cope continued
his march through Badenoch to Inverness, so that
the south of Scotland was left unprotected, and the
young Pretender improved this unexpected advantage,
and accordingly entered the county of Athol, seized the
Castle of Blair, proceeded afterwards to Perth and
Dundee, proclaiming his Father by new magistrates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his own appointment, levying the public money, and
assuming other acts of royalty. The number of the
rebels had increased to four thousand men, and on the
11th of September the young Chevalier marched from
Perth, passed the Forth on the 13th, and on the 16th
of that month, at night, arrived in the vicinity of
Edinburgh. At five o'clock on the following morning
the city was unaccountably surrendered to him without
resistance. He then made his public entry, attired in
Highland costume, and occupied the royal palace of
Holyrood House. General Guest, who commanded the
garrison of Edinburgh Castle, removed the bank, and
the effects of the principal inhabitants into that fortress,
which greatly disappointed the young Prince, who
expected to gain possession of the treasure. His
Father was afterwards proclaimed with great ceremony
at the High Cross, as King of Great Britain and
Ireland.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Cope, in the meanwhile,
had marched with his troops from Inverness to Aberdeen,
where they took shipping, and landed at Dunbar,
twenty-seven miles east of Edinburgh, on the 18th of
September, when he was reinforced by Brigadier-General
Fowke, with two regiments of dragoons, from
Edinburgh. The next day he advanced towards that
city to observe the disposition of the rebels, who were
now increased to upwards of five thousand men.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September Lieut.-General Sir John
Cope encamped in the neighbourhood of <em>Preston-Pans</em>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
near the sea, and seven miles from Edinburgh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
His army consisted of the following regiments:&mdash;</p>

<p>Information being received of the approach of the
enemy, Sir John Cope drew up his army at <em>Gladsmuir
Heath</em>, between the hamlets of <em>Preston-Pans</em> and
Cockenzie. About three o'clock on the morning of the
21st of September, large bodies of rebel Highlanders
were in motion, and before daybreak a chosen band of
these hardy mountaineers advanced with great celerity
and intrepidity to attack the royalists. As they drew
near, they raised a fearful yell, fired a volley, threw
down their muskets, and rushed sword in hand upon
the troops which guarded the artillery. The sudden
advance of the Highlanders in the dark, their superior
numbers, and peculiar mode of fighting, dismayed the
two hundred soldiers appointed to guard the artillery
on the right, who saw themselves assaulted by more
than three times their own numbers, and as they
caught the gleam of steel flashing in their faces, gave
way and fled. The two hundred and fifty dragoons on
the right, seeing the artillery lost, became disheartened;
they advanced to charge a large mass of Highlanders,
but observing the disparity of numbers, they were
seized with a panic and galloped from the field.</p>

<p>This inauspicious commencement of the action
damped the spirits of the infantry, and the panic spread
from rank to rank; several companies made resistance,
and feats of valour were displayed by individuals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
small parties; all semblance of order was, however,
soon lost, and a confused rout ensued.</p>

<p>About four hundred of the royal forces were killed
or wounded, and the prisoners, who amounted to nearly
twelve hundred men, were removed to Edinburgh, and
afterwards to the Highlands.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment had the following
officers taken prisoners: Lieut.-Colonel Clayton,
Major Talbot, Captains Reid, John Cochran, Scot,
Thomas Leslie, and Blackes; Lieutenants Thomas
Hay, Cranston, Disney, Wale, Wry, and Simms;
Ensigns Sutherland, Lucey, Holdane, Birnie, and
L'Estrange; and Adjutant Spencer.</p>

<p>This successful commencement of the rebellion caused
numerous adherents to flock to the Prince's standard;
several regiments were recalled from the continent
in October, and His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland proceeded to take the command of the
royal army. The young Pretender, elated with the
capture of Carlisle, marched as far as Derby, from
whence, however, he commenced his retreat to the
north on the 6th of December, as he found but few
partisans in England to join him in his expedition.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, after capturing the rebel
garrison of Carlisle, returned to London, leaving the
command of the army to Lieut.-General Hawley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>In January 1746, Stirling was closely invested by
the young Chevalier, and Lieut.-General Hawley
marched to its relief. An engagement occurred at
<em>Falkirk</em> on the 17th of January, in which the Prince
was again victorious. The Duke of Cumberland now
proceeded to Edinburgh, reassumed the command
of the army, and on the 2nd of February entered
Stirling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortune no longer favored the young Chevalier,
who fixed his head-quarters at Inverness. The inclemency
of the season having abated, the Duke of Cumberland,
on the 8th of April, advanced towards the
enemy, and gained a complete victory over him on the
16th of April, near <em>Culloden House</em>, four miles east of
Inverness.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>By official documents it appears, that on the 22nd of
March, 1746, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment was stationed
at Berwick, and on the 16th of April following, the
date of the Battle of <em>Culloden</em>, the subjoined letter was
addressed to the officer commanding the first division
of the regiment, then at Tuxford, in Nottinghamshire,
which indicates that the corps had commenced its march
towards London:&mdash;</p>

<p>Prince Charles, after enduring many hardships, succeeded
in escaping to France in September. In the
following month the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment embarked
at Portsmouth for Jersey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>The rebellion being suppressed, several regiments
returned to Flanders, and on the 2nd of July, 1747,
the Duke of Cumberland engaged the French at
<em>Laffeld</em>, or <em>Val</em>, where the Allies suffered severely from
the misconduct of the Dutch troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>The Allies again took the field in the summer of
1748, but hostilities were at length terminated by the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which was signed on the 7th
of October, 1748. By it all the great treaties, from
that of Westphalia in 1648, which first recognised the
principle of a balance of power in Europe, to that of
Vienna in 1738, were renewed and confirmed. Prussia
retained Silesia, and the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa
was guaranteed in the possession of her hereditary
dominions, according to the Pragmatic Sanction. France
surrendered her conquests in Flanders, and England
those in the East and West Indies; all therefore Great
Britain gained by the war was the glory of having supported
the German sovereignty of Maria Theresa, and
of having adhered to former treaties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Several regiments were disbanded in consequence of
the termination of the war. On the disbandment of
Colonel Spotswood's (afterwards Gooche's) American
Provincial Corps, then numbered the <em>forty-third</em> regiment,
and of the ten Marine regiments from the <em>forty-fourth</em>
to the <em>fifty-third</em>, the numerical titles of six of
the seven regiments raised in 1741, were changed, and
the <em>fifty-seventh</em> became the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1749</div>

<p>In the year 1749 the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment proceeded
to Ireland, where it remained for eight years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>In the Royal Warrant, dated the 1st of July, 1751,
for ensuring uniformity in the clothing, standards, and
colours of the army, and regulating the number and
rank of regiments, the facings of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment were directed to be yellow. The first, or
King's colour, was the Great Union; the second, or
Regimental colour, was of yellow silk, with the Union
in the upper canton; in the centre of the colour the
number of the rank of the regiment, in gold Roman
characters, within a wreath of roses and thistles on the
same stalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, the
peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was interrupted by the aggressions
of the French on the British territory in
North America, and early in 1756 the King of France
prepared a powerful armament for the capture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
island of Minorca. In consequence of this attack on
Minorca, hostilities became inevitable on the part of
Great Britain, and on the 18th of May war was
declared against France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<p>On the 7th of May 1757, the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, and
other regiments, embarked at Cork, for Nova Scotia,
being intended to form part of an expedition under
Major-General the Earl of Loudoun, for the attack
upon Cape Breton, an island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
On arriving at Halifax, the seventeenth,
forty-second, <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, and the second battalion
of the sixtieth regiments were formed in brigade
under Major-General James Abercromby; but the
French at Louisburg having been reinforced, the
expedition was deferred until the following year, and the
regiment remained in Nova Scotia during the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>While the expedition under Lieut.-General (afterwards
Lord) Amherst proceeded in May, 1758, against
Cape Breton,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was ordered
to join the body of troops under Major-General James
Abercromby, selected to attack the fort of <em>Ticonderoga</em>.
This force, which comprised the twenty-seventh, forty-second,
forty-fourth, <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, and fifty-fifth
regiments, embarked on Lake George on the 5th of
July, and landed on the following day near the
extremity of the lake, from whence the troops marched
through a wild and thickly-wooded country, in four
columns, upon <em>Ticonderoga</em>; the guides mistook the
route through the trackless woods, and on the 6th of
July, a skirmish ensued with a body of French troops,
in which Brigadier-General George Augustus Viscount
Howe (of the fifty-fifth regiment) was killed. With this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
exception the British sustained but small loss, while the
enemy had three hundred killed, and one hundred and
forty-eight taken prisoners. On the 8th of July, the
British appeared before the fort, which was situated on
a tongue of land, projecting into Lake Champlain, and
was built by the French in 1756. It could only be
approached on one side, which was strongly fortified;
the other three sides being surrounded by water. Felled
trees, with their branches outward, were spread before
the works, which were defended by between four and
five thousand men.</p>

<p>The engineer having reported that the entrenchment
might be forced by musketry alone, Major-General
Abercromby, unfortunately, determined to attack the
place without waiting for the artillery, which, on account
of the badness of the ground, could not be easily
brought up. A rumour also that the French were
about to be reinforced with three thousand men, confirmed
the General in his resolution. Although the
troops behaved with the utmost gallantry in the
attack on fort <em>Ticonderoga</em>, on the 8th July, it was
found impossible to succeed in the undertaking, and
after many unavailing efforts, during a desperate contest
of upwards of four hours, Major-General Abercromby
gave orders to withdraw, and the British
returned to their camp on the south of Lake George,
where they arrived on the following evening.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>The following officers belonging to the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment were killed on this occasion: Lieut.-Colonel
Samuel Beaver, Captains George Needham and
Edward Wynne; Lieutenants Jacob Laulhé and
Arthur Lloyd; Ensign George Crofton, and Quarter-Master
Thomas Carbonell.</p>

<p>In the year 1759, it was proposed to attack the
French in all their strong posts in Canada at once, so
as to fall as nearly as possible at the same time upon
Crown Point, Niagara, and the forts to the south of
Lake Erie, while a great naval armament, and a considerable
body of land forces under Major-General
James Wolfe, should attempt Quebec by the river St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Amherst, who commanded the
British forces in America, was to attack Ticonderoga
and Crown Point, by Lake George; the reduction of
these forts would command the Lake Champlain, where
having established a sufficient naval force, he was by
the river Sorel, which forms the communication between
this lake and the river St. Lawrence, to proceed to
Quebec, and effect a junction with Major-General Wolfe.</p>

<p>The third of the grand operations was against <em>Fort
Niagara</em>, near the celebrated falls of that name, a place
of great consequence. The reduction of this place was
committed to Brigadier-General John Prideaux (fifty-fifth
regiment), under whom Sir William Johnson
commanded the provincials of New York, and several
Indians of the Five Nations, who were engaged in the
British service, by the credit that gentleman had
obtained among their tribes. It was to this portion of
the army that the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was attached.</p>

<p>The troops which had been appointed to proceed to
Niagara, arrived at the fort in July. This was a very
important post, and was situated at the entrance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
strait by which Lake Ontario is joined to Lake Erie.
A little above the fort is the cataract of Niagara, the
most remarkable in the world, for the quantity of
water, and the greatness of the fall. The siege of the
place had not been long formed, before Brigadier-General
Prideaux was killed in the trenches, by the
bursting of a cohorn. This occurred on the 20th of
July, and the accident threatened to throw a damp on
the operations; but Sir William Johnson, upon whom
the command devolved, omitted nothing to continue
the vigorous measures of his predecessor, and added to
them everything his own genius could suggest.</p>

<p>The French were alarmed for the safety of the fort,
and collected all the troops they could draw from their
posts about the lakes, and to these were joined a large
body of Indians; the whole advanced to raise the siege,
and they amounted in all, to seventeen hundred men.</p>

<p>It was on the 23rd of July, that Sir William Johnson
received intelligence of the approach of the enemy to
relieve the fort, and instantly made a disposition to
defeat their designs. The guard of the trenches was
commanded by Major John Beckwith, of the forty-fourth
regiment, and, lest the garrison should sally
out, and either attempt to surprise or overpower that
guard, by which the British would have been hemmed
in between two fires, the forty-fourth regiment, under
Lieut.-Colonel William Farquhar, was posted in such
manner as to be able to sustain Major Beckwith.</p>

<p>The road on the left of the line, which led from the
cataract to the fort, was occupied by the light infantry,
and piquets of the army, on the evening of the 23rd of
July; early next morning these were reinforced by the
grenadiers and part of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, the
whole commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Eyre Massey, of
the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, to whose good conduct in the distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the troops, and the steadiness with which he
received the enemy in front, while the Indians in
British pay, attacked them on the flanks, the honor of
the day was in a great degree attributable. The
French were completely defeated, and all their officers
were made prisoners, among whom were Monsieur
Aubry, De Lignery, Marin, and Repentini.</p>

<p>This action sealed the fate of <em>Fort Niagara</em>, which
surrendered on the following day (25th of July), and
Sir William Johnson, Bart., in his despatch to Lieut.-General
Amherst, of that date, thus alluded to the
conduct of the troops:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Permit me to assure you, in the whole progress of
the siege, which was severe and painful, the officers
and men behaved with the utmost cheerfulness and
bravery."</p></div>

<p>In the meantime the siege of <em>Ticonderoga</em> was prosecuted
with vigour by the troops under Lieut.-General
Amherst, and on the 25th of July the garrison blew up
the fort, and sailed to <em>Crown Point</em>, another fort on
Lake Champlain, which place the French also abandoned,
and retired down the lake to <em>Isle aux Noix</em>;
<em>Crown Point</em> was occupied by the British on the 4th of
August following.</p>

<p>The operations against Quebec by the troops under
Major-General James Wolfe, caused the year to end
in a most triumphant manner to the British Arms.
The battle fought on the 13th of September, 1759, on
the Heights of <em>Abraham</em>, in which the Major-General
was killed, led to the surrender of Quebec, which
capitulated five days afterwards.</p>

<p>While the above operations were being performed,
Lieut.-General Amherst found that the command of
Lake Champlain was still an object of some difficulty,
although the retreat of the French from Crown Point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and Ticonderoga had left him master of Lake
George. In October the troops embarked in boats,
and proceeded a considerable distance along the
lake, but the season became too advanced for operations,
which were postponed to the following year, and the
force returned to Crown Point and Ticonderoga for
winter-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>The French endeavoured to regain possession of
Quebec, and after the battle of <em>Sillery</em> fought before that
place on the 28th of April, 1760, in which, from their
superiority in numbers they had the advantage, trenches
were immediately opened by them before the town.
The arrival of the English fleet in May dissipated all
fears for the safety of Quebec, and nothing now remained
to cloud the prospect of the reduction of Canada,
by the united efforts of three British armies, which, by
different routes, were marching to attack those parts
of the country that remained in the power of France.</p>

<p>A large army was collected at Oswego by Lieut.-General
Amherst, which the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment
joined in the afternoon of the 6th of August. The
whole army embarked on the 10th of August, and the
grenadiers, amounting to about six hundred men, were
embodied, and placed under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Eyre Massey of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment.
Dispositions were afterwards made for the attack of
<em>Fort Levi</em>, on <em>L'Isle Royale</em>, and after two days' sharp
firing, the fort surrendered on the 25th of August, of
which Lieut.-Colonel Massey, with three companies of
grenadiers, took possession.</p>

<p>After spending some days in repairing this post, and
in fitting out the vessels for passing the troops down
the river St. Lawrence, the most difficult part of which
was now to be encountered; notwithstanding all precautions,
nearly ninety men were drowned in passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the dangerous falls, and a great number of vessels
broke to pieces. After a tedious voyage the British
came in sight of the Island of Montreal on the 6th of
September.</p>

<p>The troops were immediately landed, and all dispositions
were made for attacking the place, and so
excellently was the plan concerted, that Brigadier-General
the Honorable James Murray landed from
Quebec on that very day, and Colonel Haviland with
his force from Isle-au-Noix on the following day.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Vaudreuil, the French Governor-General,
saw himself entirely enclosed, and was compelled
to surrender the garrison of Montreal on the
8th of September; thus was completed the <em>Conquest of
Canada</em>, which vast country has since continued under
the dominion of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>The regiment remained in North America until
October 1761, when it embarked for Barbadoes, where
an armament was being assembled for the attack of the
French West India Islands, and the land forces were
placed under the orders of Major-General the Honorable
Robert Monckton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>The armament sailed from Carlisle Bay, in Barbadoes,
on the 5th of January, 1762, and proceeded
against the island of <em>Martinique</em>, which was settled by
the French about the year 1635. After menacing the
coast at several points, a landing was effected in the
middle of January in Cas des Navières Bay; many
difficulties were encountered from the rugged surface
of the country, and from the formidable heights occupied
by the enemy, but these were overcome by British
skill, discipline, and valour; the heights of <em>Morne Tartenson</em>
were carried on the 24th of January, and of
<em>Morne Garnier</em> on the 27th; <em>Fort Royal</em> surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on the 4th of February, and these successes were followed
by the submission of the island to the British
Crown.</p>

<p>Major-General the Honorable Robert Monckton
commended the conduct of the troops in his despatch,
and added,&mdash;"The difficulties they had to encounter in
the attack of an enemy, possessed of every advantage
that art or nature could give them, were great.
Their perseverance in surmounting these obstacles
furnishes a noble example of British spirit:" and
in alluding to the conduct of the three divisions of
grenadiers, one division of which was commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable John Vaughan, at this
period Lieut.-Colonel commandant of the ninety-fourth
(since disbanded), but who was appointed to the
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment in November following, added,
that "they had particularly distinguished themselves,
the warmest part of the service having fallen to their
lot."</p>

<p>The capture of <em>Martinique</em> was followed by the submission
of <em>Grenada</em>, <em>St. Lucia</em>, and <em>St. Vincent</em>.</p>

<p>War had in the interim been declared against Spain,
and the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> joined the armament under
General the Earl of Albemarle, destined to proceed
against the wealthy Spanish settlement of the <em>Havannah</em>,
in the Island of Cuba. On the 7th of June a landing
was effected, and on the 9th the troops took up a
position between Coximar and the Moro Fort. Extraordinary
difficulties were encountered in making the
approaches, and carrying on the siege, while a severe
sickness prevailed amongst the seamen and soldiers.
Every obstacle was, however, overcome by the unanimity
which existed between the land and sea forces.
The <em>Moro</em> fort, which protected the harbour, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
regarded as almost impregnable, was captured by storm
on the 30th of July; on the 11th of August a series of
batteries opened so well-directed a fire on the defences
of the town, that the guns of the garrison were soon
silenced, and flags of truce were hung out. On the
13th of August the town of the Havannah, with all its
dependencies, and the ships of war in the harbour, surrendered,
and the British troops took possession of this
valuable settlement. Negociations for peace were
shortly afterwards commenced, and the preliminary
articles were signed at Fontainebleau by the Duke of
Bedford on the 3rd of November, 1762.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>The treaty of Fontainebleau was concluded at Paris
on the 10th of February, 1763, the ratifications were
exchanged on the 10th of March, and peace was proclaimed
in London on the 22nd of that month.</p>

<p>By this treaty the whole of Canada, part of Louisiana,
together with Cape Breton, and the other islands in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, were ceded to Great Britain.
In the West Indies, the islands of Tobago, Dominica,
St. Vincent, and Grenada, were retained by Great
Britain; but Martinique, Guadaloupe, Marigalante,
and St. Lucia, were restored to France. In the East
Indies, the French obtained the restitution of their
settlements, but agreed not to erect any fortifications
in Bengal. Minorca was restored to England in exchange
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'for Belleisle'">for Belle-Isle</ins>, which had been captured by the
British in 1761, and it was stipulated that the fortifications
of Dunkirk should be demolished. Spain ceded
East and West Florida to Great Britain, in return for
the restitution of the Havannah, Manilla, and all the
places which Spain had lost since the commencement
of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>In the meanwhile the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
returned to North America, where it remained for the
four following years.</p>

<p>Colonel the Honorable William Howe was appointed
by His Majesty King George III. from the fifty-eighth
to the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment on the
21st of November, 1764, in succession to Lieut.-General
the Honorable Thomas Murray, deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767</div>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1767 the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment returned to Great Britain, and was stationed
in Ireland for eight years.</p>

<p>Serious disputes had, in the meantime, arisen,
on the subject of taxation, between the colonists in
North America and the British Government. The
passing of the Stamp Act, in 1764, was the first cause
of irritation, but the spirit of discontent was partially
allayed by its repeal in 1766. This feeling was again
aroused, in the following year, by the Bill for levying
duties on certain articles imported from England, which
was repealed in 1770, with the exception of the duty
on tea, which was retained as an assertion of the right
of taxation inherent in the British Legislature. After
the cargoes of tea sent to Boston in 1773 had been
emptied into the sea, an Act of Parliament was passed
in the year 1774 for closing that port.</p>

<p>The colonists adopted retaliatory measures, and subsequently
made preparations for an appeal to arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>On the 19th of April, 1775, the first hostile collision
took place at <em>Lexington</em>, between His Majesty's troops
and the Colonists in the unhappy contest, which was
soon to assume a most formidable character.</p>

<p>Upon Major-General the Honorable Sir William
Howe, K.B., being removed to the colonelcy of the
twenty-third Royal Welsh Fusiliers, on the 11th of
May, 1775, Brevet Colonel the Honorable John Vaughan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was appointed to the vacant colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment.</p>

<p>The conflict at Lexington was followed by the battle of
<em>Bunker's Hill</em>, which was fought on the 17th of June, 1775.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>These events caused several regiments to be embarked
for America early in the year 1776; the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
embarked from Ireland at this period, and arrived
on the coast of North Carolina early in April,
when Major-General Henry Clinton, who was serving
with the local rank of General in America, assumed the
command. The men landed at Cape Fear to refresh
themselves after the voyage, and returning on board
the transports, sailed on the 1st of June with the
expedition against <em>Charleston</em>. After passing Charleston
bar, the troops landed on one of the islands; but the
armament proved of insufficient strength for the capture
of the capital of South Carolina, and the troops re-embarked
and proceeded to Staten Island, where the main
body of the British forces had assembled under Major-General
the Honorable Sir William Howe, K.B., who
was serving with the local rank of General in America.
The seventeenth, fortieth, <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, and fifty-fifth
regiments were here formed in brigade under
Major-General James Grant.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1776, the American Congress
issued their declaration of independence, abjuring
their allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain, and all
hope of accommodation failed.</p>

<p>A landing was effected by the British on <em>Long
Island</em> on the 22nd of August, and in the evening of
the 26th the army was put in motion to pass a range of
woody heights, which intersect the island, and to attack
the American force in position beyond the hills. The
column under Major-General Grant, of which the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
formed part, was directed to advance along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
coast, with ten pieces of cannon, to draw the enemy's
attention to that quarter. Moving forward at the appointed
hour, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'this columm fell'">this column fell</ins> in with the advanced
parties of the Americans about midnight, and at daybreak
on the following morning, encountered a large
body of troops formed in an advantageous position,
defended by artillery. Skirmishing and cannonading
ensued, and were continued until the Americans discovered
by the firing at <em>Brooklyn</em>, that the left of their
army had been turned and forced, when they retreated in
great confusion through a morass. The American army,
being driven from its positions with severe loss, made a
precipitate retreat to their fortified lines at <em>Brooklyn</em>.</p>

<p>The Americans quitted their fortified lines during
the night of the 28th of August, and retired across the
East River, in boats, to New York; the reduction
of <em>Long Island</em> was accomplished in a few days, with
little loss.</p>

<p>The regiment shared in the operations by which the
capture of <em>New York</em> was accomplished: also in the
movements by which the Americans were driven from
<em>White Plains</em>, and in the reduction of <em>Fort Washington</em>.</p>

<p>After the reduction of Fort Washington, and of Fort
Lee on the opposite side of the North, or Hudson's
River, the regiment continued the pursuit of the enemy
across the Jerseys, by Elizabeth Town, Raway, &amp;c.
towards Philadelphia, and remained during the following
winter at Amboy.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment occupied an old transport
ship as a barrack, and being actively employed during
the winter in constant escorts of ammunition, was continually
attacked between that place and New Brunswick,
on the way to Trenton, Princetown, and Burlington,
where the advance of the British army had
taken up winter quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>During the winter, General Washington suddenly
passed the Delaware river, and succeeded in surprising
and making prisoners a corps of Hessians at Trenton,
but he afterwards made a precipitate retreat. Being
reinforced, he again crossed the river, and took up a
position at Trenton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>Information having been received that the Americans
were forming magazines at <em>Peek's Hill</em>, about fifty miles
up the North River, the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was
detached against that post, with a body of troops, which
sailed from New York on the 22nd of March, 1777, and
as they approached Peek's Hill, the Americans set fire
to the stores, and retreated. The British landed, completed
the destruction of the magazines, barracks, &amp;c.,
and subsequently returned to their former quarters at
New York.</p>

<p>Afterwards taking the field with the army in the
Jerseys, the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was engaged in the
operations designed to bring the enemy to a general
engagement; but the Americans kept close in their fortified
lines in the mountains; an expedition against the
populous and wealthy city of <em>Philadelphia</em> was next
undertaken.</p>

<p>Embarking from Sandy Hook, the army, of which the
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> formed part, proceeded to the Chesapeake,
and landed on the northern shore of the Elk river on
the 25th of August. The American army took up a
position at <em>Brandywine</em>, to oppose the advance, and on
the 11th of September the Royal forces moved forward
to engage their opponents. The action proved decisive;
the enemy was driven from his position, and forced to
make a precipitate retreat. The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> sustained
but trifling loss on this occasion.</p>

<p>In order to harass the Royal forces, General Washington
posted several detachments in such a manner as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to command all the roads and avenues to their encampment.
He seized every opportunity of drawing detached
parties into ambuscades, which was the more readily
effected, as the country was in his interest, and the provincial
army abounded with persons fully acquainted
with all its local advantages.</p>

<p>A very considerable detachment employed in this
manner, lay concealed in the depth of a forest at a short
distance behind the British camp; it consisted of fifteen
hundred men, commanded by General Wayne.</p>

<p>General Sir William Howe, upon receiving this intelligence,
despatched Major-General Charles (afterwards
Earl) Grey with a body of troops in the middle of the
night of the 20th of September to surprise the detachment
of the enemy.</p>

<p>The light company of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was
engaged in this enterprise, which was conducted with
singular address and intrepidity. The troops advanced
in profound silence to the outposts of the enemy,
which were surprised and secured without the least
noise. It was then between twelve and one. The
main body of the American army, unapprised of
its danger, had retired to rest. Directed by the light
of the camp fires, the party under Major-General Grey
proceeded undiscovered to the enemy's encampment, and
rushed upon the foe with their bayonets. Three
hundred Americans were killed and wounded, and a
great number taken prisoners, with most of their arms
and baggage. Obscurity saved those that escaped,
as it had before at Brandywine Creek. The British
had only one officer, one serjeant, and one private soldier
killed, and a few men wounded, in this attack.</p>

<p>It was this affair which gave the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment
<em>Red Feathers</em>, which it has ever since worn. The
origin of the distinction is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The Americans having vowed vengeance for the above
attack, and that they would give no quarter, the soldiers
of the <em>light battalion</em> on this declared, that to
prevent any one not engaged in the action from suffering
on their account, they had stained their feathers
<em>red</em>, as a distinguishing mark.</p>

<p>The British army advanced upon Philadelphia, took
possession of that city, and occupied a position at
<em>Germantown</em>. The Americans attempted to surprise
the British troops early on the morning of the 4th of
October, and at first gained some advantage, but were
speedily repulsed with severe loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>The regiment passed the winter in quarters at
Philadelphia, and in the spring of 1778, it furnished
several detachments, which ranged the country in various
directions to open communications for obtaining
provisions. At this period General the Honorable Sir
William Howe had returned to England, and resigned
the command of the army to General Sir Henry
Clinton, K.B. The regiment also took part in the
fatigues and difficulties of the march of the army from
Philadelphia, through the Jerseys, in order to return
to New York, and the flank companies were engaged
on the 28th of June in repulsing the attack of the
enemy on the rear of the column at <em>Monmouth Court-House</em>,
near <em>Freehold</em>, in New Jersey.</p>

<p>The army had marched from Philadelphia to New
York in consequence of the King of France having
engaged to aid the Americans, which circumstance
changed the character of the war. Shortly after the
arrival of the British army at New York a powerful
French armament appeared off that port. The enemy
had a great superiority of numbers; but the enthusiasm
in the British navy and army was unbounded, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hour of contest was looked forward to with sanguine
expectations. The enemy did not, however, venture
to hazard an attack; but proceeded against Rhode
Island; a numerous body of Americans co-operated
in the enterprise, and besieged Newport. The British
fleet put to sea, and the thirty-third, forty-second,
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, and sixty-fourth regiments embarked,
under Major-General Grey, to join the fleet at the east
end of Long Island.</p>

<p>When the transports were about to sail, information
was received of the departure of the French fleet from
Rhode Island, and while at sea, news arrived of the
Americans having raised the siege of Newport. The
troops were then directed to proceed against <em>Bedford</em>,
on the Accushnet river, a noted place for American
privateers. On the evening of the 5th of September
the troops landed,&mdash;overcame all opposition,&mdash;destroyed
seventy privateers and other ships,&mdash;demolished
the fort and artillery,&mdash;blew up the magazine,&mdash;destroyed
an immense quantity of naval stores, &amp;c., and
returned on board the transports at noon on the following
day. The troops afterwards proceeded against
Martha's Vineyard,&mdash;destroyed the defences,&mdash;took
three hundred and eighty-eight stand of arms from the
militia,&mdash;obliged the inhabitants to deliver up three
hundred oxen, ten thousand sheep, and a thousand
pounds sterling collected by the Congress. After this
success the regiment returned to New York.</p>

<p>A powerful French armament menacing the British
possessions in the West Indies, the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, and
other regiments, sailed from North America, early in
November, for Barbadoes, under Major-General James
Grant.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the reinforcements at Barbadoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the British naval and military commanders resolved to
attack the French island of <em>St. Lucia</em>. On this occasion
the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was formed in brigade
with the fifteenth, twenty-eighth, and fifty-fifth regiments,
under Major-General Prescott.</p>

<p>The expedition sailed from Carlisle Bay on the 12th
of December, a landing was effected at <em>St. Lucia</em> on the
following day, and on the 14th the French troops were
driven from several important posts. In the meantime
a French armament of very superior numbers
approached the island, and the British took up positions
to repel the enemy. The French fleet made a
desperate attack on the British naval force, but was
repulsed.</p>

<p>A numerous body of the enemy landed, and, on the
18th of December, stormed the post of <em>La Vigie</em>, which
was occupied by the grenadiers and light infantry (of
which the flank companies of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> formed
part), and the fifth regiment, under Brigadier-General
Medows. The enemy amounted to nine thousand
men, commanded by Monsieur D'Estaing, the Marquis
de Bouillé, and M. Lavendahl, and advanced in three
columns; their first two attacks were made, to quote
the words of Major-General Grant's despatch, "with
the impetuosity of Frenchmen, and repulsed with the
determined bravery of Britons." The French made
a third attempt, but were soon broken, and were forced
to re-embark, leaving the ground covered with killed
and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment
had an opportunity of distinguishing themselves on
this occasion, and Lieutenant William Gomm was
wounded.</p>

<p>The loss of the French amounted to about four hundred
killed and eleven hundred wounded, while the
killed on the side of the British was only ten, and one
hundred and thirty wounded. The sense Major-General
Grant entertained of the services of Brigadier-General
Medows and the detachment under his command,
was expressed in the following letter, dated from
<em>Morne Fortunée</em>, the 19th of December, 1778:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in2">"I cannot express how much I feel obliged to you,
and the troops under your command, for repulsing,
with so much spirit and bravery, so great a body of
the enemy, and own it was just what I expected from
you and them; and I am sure, under your command,
they will always behave in such a manner as to do
honor to you, themselves, their King, and their country;
and I must beg of you to express my gratitude.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr10">"I have, &amp;c.,</span><br />

"<em>Major-General</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent fs80">"<em>Brigadier-General Medows</em>, <em>&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</em>"</p></div>

<p>Immediately after the departure of the French armament,
the governor surrendered the island of <em>St. Lucia</em>
to the British troops, the capitulation being signed on
the 30th of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In 1779 the Court of Spain commenced hostilities
against Great Britain, and this example was followed
by the Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment remained in the West
Indies until the year 1782, when it returned to
England.</p>

<p>A letter, dated the 31st of August, 1782, conveyed
to the regiment His Majesty's pleasure, that County
Titles should be conferred on the Infantry, and the
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> was directed to assume the designation of
the <span class="fs70">SOUTH DEVONSHIRE</span> regiment, in order that a connexion
between the regiment and that part of the
county should be cultivated, which might be useful in
promoting the success of the recruiting service.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1782, the preliminary
Articles of Peace were signed at Paris between Great
Britain and the United States of America, and the
treaty was concluded in the ensuing February.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>The preliminaries of the treaties between England,
France, and Spain, were signed at Versailles on the
20th of January, 1783. <em>St. Lucia</em> was restored to
France, also the settlements on the river Senegal and
the city of Pondicherry in the East Indies. France
relinquished all her West India conquests, with the
exception of Tobago; Spain retained Minorca (which
had surrendered to the combined French and Spanish
forces in the previous year), and West Florida; East
Florida was ceded in exchange for the restitution of
the Bahamas to Great Britain.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, 1783, were signed the
preliminary Articles of Peace with Holland, the treaty
with that country having been postponed in consequence
of the Dutch claiming an indemnification for the
expenses of the war, and the restoration of Trincomalee,
in Ceylon, which had been captured from the Dutch
by the English in January of the previous year, and
retaken by the French in August following. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
place was, however, restored to Holland at the general
peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment proceeded from Plymouth
to Ireland on the 21st of February, 1784, and continued
in that country during the eight following
years.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1792</div>

<p>In February, 1792, the regiment proceeded from
Ireland to Gibraltar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>While the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment was stationed at
Gibraltar, the French revolutionary war commenced,
and in the year 1794, the islands of Martinique, St.
Lucia, and Guadaloupe were captured by the British.
The French republican government fitted out an expedition
for the recovery of these islands, and some
success attended their efforts. This occurrence occasioned
an order to be given for the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment to be embarked from Gibraltar to reinforce
the British troops in the West Indies. The regiment
accordingly embarked in November, 1794, and arrived
in the following month at the island of Martinique.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The republican emissaries employed by France
having organized an insurrection in the island of <em>St.
Vincent</em>, where the native Caribs, and several of the
French inhabitants were in arms against the British
government, occasioned the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment to
be ordered to St. Vincent.</p>

<p>At Dorsetshire Hill, the Caribs hoisted the tri-coloured
flag, and burnt every plantation in their
power. The loyal inhabitants of the island assembled
at Kingston, and in the fort, and every means of
defence which the colony afforded, were used by
Governor Seton.</p>

<p>It being determined to storm <em>Dorsetshire Hill</em>,
Governor Seton selected a force for this enterprise, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which a company of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, which
had arrived from Martinique, under the command of
Captain Dugald Campbell, formed part. Shortly
after twelve o'clock, on the night of the 14th of March,
the troops mounted the steep and rugged path in
regularity and silence. They ascended within eighty
yards of the main post, when they were discovered by
the enemy's sentry, who challenged and fired. The
Caribs, undismayed by the surprise, shouted, and
opened a smart fire of musketry on the British. As
soon as the troops were within twenty yards of the
enemy, orders were given to fire a volley and charge,
which were obeyed with the greatest alacrity. While
a portion of the British force mounted the bank at one
place, the detachment of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment,
under Captain Campbell, ascended another part of the
bank. The buildings which sheltered the enemy were
stormed, but many escaped through the darkness of the
night. Chatoye, the Carib king, was killed with
several of his adherents, and the enemy's two pieces of
cannon were captured.</p>

<p><em>Dorsetshire Hill</em> being too extensive a position, was
abandoned early on the following morning, and the
British returned to Sion Hill.</p>

<p>The remainder of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment having
arrived, enabled the governor to make a second attack
upon the enemy on the 10th of April, when the Caribs
were driven from their positions with considerable loss
on their side, but small on the part of the British.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, the enemy appeared on the
height above <em>Calliaqua</em>, in the vicinity of which was
situated the estate belonging to Sir William Young,
whose buildings had been previously consumed by the
Caribs, who had received reinforcements from Guadaloupe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Governor Seton, considering that some attempt would
be made against Kingston, sent on the 7th of May, a
party, under Captain John Hall, of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>,
consisting of a subaltern and thirty-three rank and
file of that regiment, forty militia, and forty of the
corps of rangers, with five of the royal artillery, and a
fourteen pound field-piece, to take possession of <em>Dorsetshire
Hill</em>. About one o'clock in the morning of the
8th of May, the party under Captain Hall was attacked
by a force of three hundred French and Caribs, and
after a vigorous resistance, was compelled to withdraw
to the post on Sion Hill, in consequence of the enemy's
great superiority in numbers, leaving the field-piece
spiked.</p>

<p>Kingston would inevitably have been destroyed, if
the enemy had kept possession of Dorsetshire Hill, and
sixty rank and file of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, under Captain
William Cooper Forster, of that regiment, were immediately
detached with other troops to attack the foe at
daybreak.</p>

<p>The Caribs, with great dexterity, found means to
clear the field-piece of the spike during the short time
they had it in their possession, and had been joined by
upwards of a hundred French and others of their party
immediately after the retreat of Captain Hall's party.
The British, however, attacked them with great spirit,
and, in less than half an hour, they retook the field-piece,
and obtained possession of the hill, the enemy
flying on all sides.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment had three rank and file
killed, and nine wounded. Captain William Cooper
Forster and Ensign Michael Lee, were also wounded.</p>

<p>On the 12th of June the troops under Lieut.-Colonel
Baldwin Leighton, of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, carried
by assault, the enemy's post <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'on the Virgie'">on the Vigie</ins>, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
occasion Captains John Law and William Cooper Forster,
of that regiment, were wounded:&mdash;after this success
the Lieut.-Colonel advanced into the Carib country,
and took up a position on Mount Young.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, 1795, Major-General James
Henry Craig was appointed Colonel of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment, in succession to Lieut.-General the
Honorable Sir John Vaughan, K.B., deceased.</p>

<p>In September, 1795, reinforcements arrived from
England, consisting of the fortieth, fifty-fourth, and
fifty-ninth regiments, and Major-General Paulus
Æmilius Irving assumed the command. The enemy,
apprised of the arrival of fresh troops, retired from
his position on Fairbane's Ridge, during the night of
the 30th of September.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of the 2nd of
October, the troops advanced against the <em>Vigie</em>, and
after a severe action, the Caribs abandoned that post,
of which possession was taken by the British.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>After this action the British remained on the defensive,
but several attacks were made by the enemy.
Major-General Peter Hunter, after an action fought on
the 8th of January, 1796, evacuated the New Vigie,
in order to provide for the safety of Fort Charlotte
and Kingston. The party from Morne Ronde was
also withdrawn.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June further reinforcements arrived
under Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.B.,
and on the following day the troops marched in one
column, by the right, as far as Stubbs, about eight
miles from Kingston; each division halted that evening
opposite to their respective points of attack. The post
of <em>New Vigie</em>, an eminence on which the enemy had
constructed four redoubts, stronger by the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
difficulties of the approach, than by the art displayed
in their formation, was attacked on the 10th of June,
and after a conflict of seven hours' duration, the Caribs
surrendered prisoners of war; but about six hundred
broke the capitulation, and escaped to the woods,
where they joined their friends at the farther end of
the island.</p>

<p>In this attack the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> had two rank and
file killed, and one wounded.</p>

<p>Troops were also despatched to <em>Mounts Young</em> and
<em>William</em>, where a number of brass ordnance, and a
quantity of ammunition, &amp;c., were taken.</p>

<p>A desultory warfare was carried on until September,
when the Caribs were forced to submit, and they were
afterwards removed from the island of St. Vincent.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, which had been engaged
with the Caribs, together, and in detachments, on
<em>thirteen</em> occasions, and in eight months had sustained a
loss of four hundred men out of five hundred and
twenty, afterwards returned to England, and arrived
at Portsmouth in November, 1796.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797<br />1799</div>

<p>While stationed in England the regiment was successively
quartered at Doncaster, York, Henley-upon-Thames,
Warminster, Poole, and Plymouth, from which
port it embarked for Ireland, towards the end of the
year 1799.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1800, the regiment
arrived at Cork, and was subsequently stationed at
Fermoy, Limerick, and Cork.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, a
treaty of peace was signed on the 27th of March, 1802,
at Amiens, but the ambitious designs of the French
ruler occasioned the war to be renewed in May, 1803.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>On the 5th of January, 1804, His Majesty King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
George III., appointed Lieut.-General John Whyte,
from the First West India regiment, to be colonel of
the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, in succession to Lieut.-General
Sir James Henry Craig, who was removed to
the eighty-sixth regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment embarked at Cork for
the West Indies, and arrived at Barbadoes in April.
In June following the regiment proceeded to <em>Dominica</em>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>In February, 1805, the island of Dominica was attacked
by the French, and the gallant conduct of the
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> on that occasion cannot be better recorded
than by the insertion of the following despatch, addressed
to Earl Camden, K.G., one of His Majesty's
principal Secretaries of State, by Lieut.-General Sir
William Myers, Bart., commanding the troops in the
Windward and Leeward Islands:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">"<em>Barbadoes, March 9th, 1805.</em></p>

<p>"My <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="in3">"I have the honor to enclose to your Lordship,
a copy of a despatch from Brigadier-General
Prevost, dated Dominica, 1st of March, 1805. The
details contained therein are so highly reputable to
the Brigadier-General, and the small portion of
troops employed against so numerous an enemy, that
I have great satisfaction in recommending that their
gallant exertions may be laid before His Majesty.</p>

<p>"The zeal and talent manifested by the brigadier-general
upon this occasion, it is my duty to present
for the royal consideration, and at the same time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
beg to be permitted to express the high sense I entertain
of the distinguished bravery of His Majesty's
troops, and the militia of the colony, employed on that
service.</p>

<p>"The vigorous resistance which the enemy have experienced,
and the loss which they have sustained in
this attack, must evince to them, that however inferior
our numbers were on this occasion, British
troops are not to be hostilely approached with impunity;
and had not the town of Roseau been accidentally
destroyed by fire, we should have little to regret,
and much to exult in.</p>

<p>"Your Lordship will perceive by the returns, that
our loss in men, compared to that of the enemy, is
but trifling; but I have sincerely to lament that of
Major Nunn, of the First West India regiment, whose
wound is reported to be of a dangerous kind; he is
an excellent man, and a meritorious officer.</p>

<span class="padr1">Dominica, March 1st, 1805.</span></em></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in2">"About an hour before the dawn of day on the
22nd ultimo, an alarm was fired from Scots Head,
and soon after a cluster of ships was discovered off
Roseau. As our light increased, I made out five
large ships, three frigates, two brigs, and small craft
under British colours, a ship of three decks carrying
a flag at the mizen. The frigates ranging too close
to Fort Young, I ordered them to be fired on, and
soon after nineteen large barges, full of troops, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
coming from the lee of the other ships, attended
and protected by an armed schooner, full of
men, and seven other boats carrying carronades. The
English flag was lowered, and that of the French
hoisted.</p>

<p>"A landing was immediately attempted on my left
flank, between the town of Roseau and the post of
Cachecrow. The light infantry of the First West
India regiment were the first on the march to support
Captain Smart's company of militia, which, throughout
the day, behaved with great gallantry; it was
immediately supported by the grenadiers of the
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment. The first boats were beat
off, but the schooner and one of the brigs coming
close on shore, to cover the landing, compelled our
troops to occupy a better position, a defile leading
to the town. At this moment I brought up the
grenadiers of the St. George's regiment of militia,
and soon after the remainder of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment, and gave over to Major Nunn these brave
troops, with orders not to yield to the enemy one inch
of ground. Two field-pieces (an amuzette and a
six-pounder), were brought into action for their support,
under the command of Serjeant Creed of the
<span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, manned by additional gunners
and sailors. These guns, and a twenty-four
pounder from Melville battery, shook the French
advancing column by the execution they did.</p>

<p>"I sent two companies of St. George's militia, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Constable, and a
company of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, to prevent the enemy
from getting into the rear of the position occupied by
Major Nunn.</p>

<p>"On my return I found the "Majestueuse" of 120<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
guns, lying opposite to Fort Young, pouring into the
town and batteries her broadsides, followed by the
other seventy-fours and frigates doing the same.</p>

<p>"Some artillery, several captains of merchantmen
with their sailors, and the militia artillery, manned
five twenty-four pounders, and three eighteens, at
the fort, and five twenty-fours at Melville battery, and
returned an uninterrupted fire; from the first post
red-hot shot were thrown. At about ten o'clock,
<span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, Major Nunn, most unfortunately for His Majesty's
service, whilst faithfully executing the order
I had given him, was wounded; I fear mortally.</p>

<p>"This did not discourage the brave fellows. Captain
O'Connell, of the First West India regiment,
received the command and a wound almost at the
same time; however, the last circumstance could not
induce him to give up the honor of the first, and he
continued on the field animating his men, and resisting
the repeated charges of the enemy, until about one
o'clock, when he obliged them to retire from their
position with great slaughter. It is impossible for
me to do justice to the merit of that officer; you will,
I doubt not, favorably report his conduct to His
Majesty, and at the same time that of Captain James,
who commanded the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, and Captain
Archibald Campbell, who commanded the grenadiers
of that corps.</p>

<p>"Foiled and beat off on the left, the right flank was
attempted, and a considerable force was landed near
Morne Daniel. The regulars not exceeding two
hundred, employed on the left in opposing the advance
of three columns, consisting of upwards of two
thousand men, could afford me no reinforcement; I
had only the right wing of the St. George's regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of militia to oppose them, of about a hundred men.
They attacked with spirit, but unfortunately the frigates
had stood in so close to the shore to protect
this disembarkation, that after receiving a destructive
fire, they fell back and occupied the heights of Woodbridge
estate. Then it was that a column of the
enemy marched up to Morne Daniel, and stormed
the redoubt defended by a small detachment, which,
after an obstinate resistance they carried. On my
left Captain O'Connell was gaining ground, notwithstanding
a fresh supply of troops and several field-pieces,
which had been brought on shore by the
enemy. I now observed a large column climbing the
mountains to get in his rear.</p>

<p>"The town, which had been for some time in flames,
was only protected by a light howitzer and a six-pounder
to the right, supported by part of the light
company of the St. George's regiment. The enemy's
large ships in Woodbridge Bay, out of the reach of
my guns, my right flank gained, and my retreat to
Prince Rupert's almost cut off, I determined on one
attempt to keep the sovereignty of the island, which
the excellent troops I had warranted. I ordered the
militia to remain at the posts, except such as were
inclined to encounter more hardships and severe service;
and Captain O'Connell, with the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment, under the command of Captain James, and
the light company of the First West India regiment,
were directed to make a forced march to Prince
Rupert's. I then allowed the President to enter into
terms for the town of Roseau; and then demanded
from the French General that private property
should be respected, and that no wanton or disgraceful
pillage should be allowed; this done, only attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
by Brigade Major Prevost, and Deputy Quarter
Master-General Hopley, of the militia forces, I
crossed the island, and in twenty-four hours, with the
aid of the inhabitants and the exertions of the Caribs,
I got to this garrison on the 23rd. After four days'
continued march, through the most difficult country, I
might almost say existing, Captain O'Connell joined
me at Prince Rupert's, himself wounded, and bringing
in his wounded, with a few of the royal artillery, and
the precious remainder of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment,
and the First West India light company.</p>

<p>"I had no sooner got to the fort, than I ordered
cattle to be driven in, and took measures for getting
a store of water from the river in the bay. I found
my signals to Lieut.-Colonel Charles Broughton, of
the First West India Regiment, made from Roseau
soon after the enemy had landed, had been received, and
that, in consequence, he had made the most judicious
arrangements his garrison would allow for the defence
of this important post.</p>

<p>"On the 25th I received the letter of summons I
have now the honor to transmit, from General of
Division La Grange, and without delay sent the
reply you will find accompanying it.</p>

<p>"On the 27th the enemy's cruisers hovered about the
head, however, the "Centaur's" tender (Vigilante)
came in, and was saved by our guns. I landed Mr.
Henderson, her commander, and crew, to assist in the
defence we were prepared to make.</p>

<p>"As far as can be collected, the enemy had about
four thousand men on board, and the whole of their
force was compelled to disembark before they gained
one inch of ground.</p>

<p>"I entrust this despatch to Captain O'Connell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to whom I beg to refer you; his services entitle him
to consideration. I am much indebted to the zeal
and discernment of Fort Adjutant Gualy, who was
very accessary to the due execution of my orders.</p>

<p>"I cannot pass unnoticed the very soldier-like conduct
of Lieutenant Wallis of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment,
to whom I had entrusted the post of Cachecrow,
or Scots Head: on perceiving our retreat he spiked
his guns, destroyed his ammunition, and immediately
commenced his march to join me at Prince Rupert's
with his detachment: nor that of Lieutenant Schaw
of the same corps, who acted as an officer of artillery,
and behaved with uncommon coolness and judgment,
while on the battery, and great presence of mind in
securing the retreat of the additional gunners belonging
to the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment. On the 27th,
after levying a contribution on Roseau, the enemy
reimbarked, and hovered that day and the next
about this post. This morning the French fleet is
seen off the south end of Guadaloupe, under easy
sail.</p>

<p>"Our loss, you will perceive by the returns I have
the honor to transmit, was inconsiderable, when compared
with that of the enemy, which included several
officers of rank, and about three hundred others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In the beginning of May, 1806, the "Dominica" armed
sloop was cut from her anchorage by her own crew, and
taken from Dominica into Guadaloupe: early on the
morning of the 6th of May, a large schooner, a row-boat
full of troops, and the "Dominica" sloop, were discovered
making out from the land, and Major-General
Stair Park Dalrymple perceiving they were suspicious,
and evidently enemy's vessels, ordered detachments
from the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment to be instantly embarked
on board the "Duke of Montrose" packet, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Dynely, who had volunteered his services, and
another on board a small colonial sloop. Lieutenant
James Wallis, of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>, was appointed to take
command of the first detachment, and under him Lieut.
Benjamin Forster and forty men; Lieutenant Andrew
Hamilton commanded the second detachment on board
the sloop. Both were successful; the "Duke of Montrose"
chased the schooner from ten <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> until four <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>,
when she engaged within musket-shot for three-quarters
of an hour. The schooner then hove up, and again
endeavoured to escape. On the packet's overhauling
fast, and being about to board her, she surrendered.
The schooner proved to be the French national schooner
<i>L'Impérial</i>, having on board General Dumareau and
eighty soldiers, and carried one large gun amidships,
which was well served during the action. Lieutenant
Andrew Hamilton also proved successful in capturing
the row-boat.</p>

<p>For these services the officers and men received the
unqualified approbation of Lieut.-General Henry
Bowyer, commanding the forces in the West Indies,
and of Major-General Dalrymple, for having so handsomely
supported the honor of their corps by their zeal,
courage, and steady discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>In 1808 an expedition was assembled at Carlisle
Bay, Barbadoes, for the reduction of the French island
of <em>Martinique</em>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the flank companies of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment were selected to form part of the expedition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>The land forces were under Lieut.-General
George Beckwith, and the navy was commanded by
Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, K.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The fleet left Carlisle Bay on the 28th of January,
1809, and arrived off the island of <em>Martinique</em> in two
days. On the 30th, the troops landed in two divisions;
the first division at Bay Robert under Lieut.-General
Sir George Prevost, and the second division, commanded
by Major-General Maitland, near St. Luce and Point
Solomon. Both divisions were actively engaged in
operations for the reduction of the island. St. Pierre
surrendered on the 8th of February, to Lieut.-Colonel
Edward Barnes of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment, who commanded
a brigade in the army employed in this
expedition.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> composed
part of the flank battalion under Major Richard Payne,
of the regiment, at the siege of <em>Fort Royal</em>.</p>

<p>The reduction of <em>Fort Desaix</em> (or Fort Bourbon) by
the first division of the army, which was effected on
the 24th of February, completed the reduction of
<em>Martinique</em>, and the flank companies rejoined the regiment
at Dominica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>In 1810, the flank companies of the regiment were
selected to form part of an expedition under Lieut.-General
Sir George Beckwith, K.B., against the island
of <em>Guadaloupe</em>, which had been restored to the French
at the Peace of Amiens. The expedition arrived before
the island in January, 1810.</p>

<p>The grenadiers composed part of the First Grenadier
Battalion, and the light company that of the Second
Light Battalion. On the 3rd of February the grenadiers
were engaged in the attack on the enemy's post
at <em>Bellair</em>, on the heights of Saint Louis, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> having been much reduced in
numbers during the arduous services of the regiment
in the West Indies, the head-quarters embarked on

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>On the 18th of March 1812, the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment
embarked on board the "Nautilus" transport at
Plymouth for Jersey, and arrived in St. Aubin's Bay
on the 11th of April, when it marched to Grouville, in
the eastern division of the island, the head-quarters
being stationed at Mont Orgueil Castle.</p>

<p>In June 1812, the four companies which had been
left in the West Indies, arrived at Portsmouth in the
"Shipley" transport, and proceeded, without landing, to
Jersey. A few officers and men, who came home from
the West Indies in the "John Tobin" merchantman,
arrived in the same month at Liverpool, and proceeded
to the regiment at Jersey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>On the 11th of June 1813, the regiment embarked
on board the "Preston" transport for Portsmouth, and
after its arrival at Spithead, received orders to proceed
to Cowes, in the Isle of Wight. It disembarked at
that place on the 16th of the same month, and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to Sandown barracks, where the regiment remained
until August following, when it received orders to proceed

<p>The regiment embarked on the 23rd of August 1813,
on board the "Wyndham," "Three Bees," and "General

its appearance and movements elicited the Major-General's
commendation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>In May 1815, Serjeant Robert Broadfoot and six
privates were sent from the detachment of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
stationed at Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, into
the interior of the colony, in order to suppress a gang
of bushrangers, which infested that settlement, and had
by their atrocious deeds become the terror of the inhabitants.
The party succeeded in taking two of the
principals, named Maguire and Burne, who were tried
and executed. The serjeant and his party received the
sum of one hundred pounds sterling, and the thanks
of Lieut.-Governor Davy for their conduct on the
occasion.</p>

<p>In May and October 1815, the regiment was inspected
by Major-General Macquarie, who again expressed
his entire approval of its appearance and
movements.</p>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in New South
Wales, the war, in which the European powers had
been engaged, was ended by the defeat of Napoleon
Bonaparte on the plains of <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, and a lengthend
period of peace has been the result of that victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>Early in February 1816, Corporal Justin McCarthy
and seven privates were sent in pursuit of bushrangers,
and on the 5th of April following, they succeeded in
taking two of them, both of whom were executed.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Henry Wynyard was appointed Colonel
of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> regiment on the 1st of April
1816, in succession to General John Whyte, deceased.</p>

<p>In the early part of April 1816, the flank companies
of the regiment were detached into the interior of New
South Wales, and received in General Orders the thanks
of Major-General Macquarie, Commanding the Forces,

corps at Sydney into the interior of the country, to protect
the inhabitants from the natives, and were employed

McCarthy and his party, in July, came up with
the main body, consisting of eleven desperate characters,
and headed by a deserter from the seventy-third regiment,
named Geary. They were all armed, each with
a musket and a brace of pistols, and well supplied with
ammunition. The corporal and his men, now reduced
to five, engaged them for an hour and a half, when the
leader of the bushrangers being mortally wounded, his
followers endeavoured to escape; two, however, were
taken, tried, and executed. The corporal and his men
received one hundred pounds for Geary, and twenty-five
pounds for each of the other two, and were highly
recommended by Lieut.-Governor Sorrell for their zeal,
courage, and perseverance.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August following, this small party
again came up with the remainder of the banditti.
Their leader was shot during the action, and another
of his followers was wounded, and made prisoner.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September, 1817, the regiment embarked

and arrived at Fort Saint George on the 12th of
October.</p>

<p>Previously to the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> quitting Vellore an
Order was issued by Colonel Hall, commanding

<h2 class="large">CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p class="p2 noindent">The scene of the principal active services of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span>
regiment, from its formation in 1741, until the
present period, has been limited to <em>North America</em> and
the <em>West India Islands</em>.</p>

<p>After the unsuccessful attach on <em>Fort Ticonderago</em> in
July, 1758, the regiment shared in the capture of <em>Fort
Niagara</em> on the 25th of July, 1759, and of other forts
in Canada, which led to the surrender of <em>Montreal</em> on
the 8th of September, 1760; and thus completed the
conquest of that country,&mdash;<em>Quebec</em> having been acquired,
in September of the preceding year, by the troops
detached under Major-General Wolfe.</p>

<p>In February, 1762, the regiment shared in the capture
of <em>Martinique</em>, which was followed by the reduction
of <em>Grenada</em>, <em>St. Lucia</em>, and <em>St. Vincent</em>; and in August
following was present at the conquest of the <em>Havannah</em>,
which last acquisition was restored to Spain at the
Peace of 1763.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked in 1776, for <em>North America</em>,
and shared in several actions of the war with the United
States until November, 1778, when it proceeded to
the <em>West Indies</em>, and participated in the capture of
<em>St. Lucia</em> in December following.</p>

<p>During the years 1795 and 1796, the regiment
was employed in the campaign against the Caribs in
<em>St. Vincent</em>, a severe and harassing service.</p>

<p>While other regiments had the opportunity of encountering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the French legions in other parts of the world,
the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> was employed in protecting the
colonial possessions of Great Britain; how efficiently
this duty was performed is testified by the word
"<span class="smcap">Dominica</span>," conferred by Royal authority, for the
gallant defence made by the regiment against a very
superior French force on the 22nd of February, 1805.
The language of Lieut.-General Sir John Hope, when
reporting the battle of <em>Corunna</em>, is alike applicable to
the conduct of the troops at <em>Dominica</em>, for there, as at
the former place,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The enemy has been taught, that whatever advantages
of position, or of <em>numbers</em> he may employ, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers, a
bravery that knows not how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances
can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure victory,
when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any
human means."</p></div>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> formed part
of the troops which reduced <em>Martinique</em> in February,
1809, and thus the services of the regiment were a
<em>second</em> time connected with the conquest of that
island.</p>

<p>In 1810, the flank companies of the regiment shared
in the reduction of <em>Guadaloupe</em>, and were honorably
mentioned in the despatches.</p>

<p>In 1811, the regiment arrived in England from the
<em>West Indies</em>, and in 1813 embarked for New South
Wales, from which country it proceeded, in 1817, to
the East Indies, and returned to Great Britain in
1833.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked for Gibraltar in 1837;
proceeded to the <em>West Indies</em> in 1842, and to <em>North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
America</em>in 1845, whence it returned, in 1848, to
England.</p>

<p>Services of the foregoing description, combined with
excellent conduct in quarters at home and abroad,
during a period of upwards of a century, have deservedly
acquired for the regiment the approbation of
the Sovereign, and the confidence of the Nation.</p>

of the island. In January 1812, he received the brevet rank
of colonel, and on the 25th of June following, he was removed
to the sixtieth regiment. His reputation was then such that
immediately on his arrival at Madrid, he was appointed to
command a brigade in the third division of the army under
the Marquis of Wellington, in which he served until the end
of the war with France, in 1814, and was present at the battles

Vice-Admiral the Honorable Sir Alexander Cochrane for the
attack on New Orleans and the province of Louisiana. On
the morning of the 23rd of December, Major-General Keane
effected a landing within nine miles of New Orleans, and the
same night, with only eighteen hundred bayonets on shore,
repulsed a serious attack of five thousand of the enemy, assisted
by three large armed vessels on their flank. He held the
command until the 25th of December, when Major-General
Sir Edward Pakenham arrived, and assumed the command of
the entire army. Major-General Keane was then appointed
to the third brigade, and was present in the affairs of the 28th
of December and 1st of January, as also at the assault made
in the enemy's fortified lines on the morning of the 8th of
January 1815, when he was severely wounded in two places.
Sir John Keane afterwards passed eight years in Jamaica
(from 1823 to 1831), as major-general commanding the forces
in that island; and, during a year and a half of the time, he
administered the civil government likewise. The colonelcy
of the ninety-fourth regiment was conferred upon him on the
18th of April 1829, and on the 22nd of July 1830, he was
promoted to the rank of lieut.-general; on the 13th of April,

1838, he received authority from the government of India to
organise and lead into Scinde a force intended to co-operate
with the army then on the north-west frontier of India, under
the command of General Sir Henry Fane. In December following
Sir Henry Fane forwarded his resignation to head-quarters,
and the command of the combined forces devolved
upon Sir John Keane, who was now called upon to lead a
considerable army, and to conduct operations requiring much
discretion, delicacy, and tact in dealing with those half-friendly
powers, whose existence is one of the greatest difficulties in
the government of a semi-civilized land. After penetrating
the Bolan Pass, the troops arrived on the 27th of April 1839
at Candahar, from whence they proceeded to Ghuznee, which
was captured by their gallant exertions on the 23rd of July<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
following. This completed the conquest of Affghanistan; and
Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk, after an exile of many years, was restored
to the throne of his ancestors. Lieut.-General Sir John
Keane, K.C.B., was removed from the <span class="fs70">FORTY-SIXTH</span> to the
forty-third regiment on the 1st of August 1839. For his
services during the expedition to Cabool, Lieut.-General Sir

Honorable Military Order of the Bath, and on the 11th of
December, was raised to the peerage as Baron Keane, of
Ghuznee in Affghanistan, and of Cappoquin, county of Waterford,
and obtained a pension of two thousand pounds a-year
for his own life and that of his two immediate successors in
the peerage, added to which he received the thanks of both
Houses of Parliament, of the Court of Directors of the East
India Company, and other marks of public approbation. These
honors were not long enjoyed by Lieut.-General Lord Keane,
who died in the sixty-fourth year of his age, at Burton Lodge,
Hampshire, on the 26th of August 1844.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
